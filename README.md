### This repository consists of various patterns solved using C++.

<p>Solving patterns helps us in understanding looping concepts in any programming language.</p>
<p>With the help of patterns you will be thorough with loops & nested loops.</p>

<b>Note: Before solving any pattern question follow these 4 steps:</b>

1) For the outer loop, count the no. of lines i.e rows.
2) For the inner loop, focus on the columns & connect them somehow to the rows.
3) Print them inside the inner for loop
4) Observe symmetry (optional for some patterns)
